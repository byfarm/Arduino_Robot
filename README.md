"# Arduino_Robot" 

This is an Arduino Robot challenge from my Engineering First Year Seminar Class at Gonzaga University. The final script is in the file named "FinalScript". In order for "FinalScript" to run, "WK09_Arduino_bfarmar" must be run in order to initialize the connection to the Arduino Robot. All necessary code is contained within these two files. All other files were simply used to construct parts of these two files. 

The context of this challenge was to have an arduino robot dropped in the center of a circular container. This circular container was about one meter in diameter and had one gap in the walls, with bright LED ligths on either side of the gap. The robot was placed in the center, then a six inch tall pvc pipe was placed anywhere in the container. The arduino's goal was to find the object, roll up to it and touch it. Then, wait for the operator to start it again. It would then scan for the exit, then drive out of it. This project was a group project, so all code was not written by me. I did write a majority of the code in the ScanSorroundings, ObjectCheck, ObjectLoc, MovementProcess, and the LightScanner functions.
